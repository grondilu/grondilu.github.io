    <p>Some time ago, I implemented a <a href=http://grondilu.github.io/cube.html>
        trackball without any trigonometric function</a>.
    In a nutshell, I did it with the following matrix:</p>

	$$\frac{1}{q^2}\begin{pmatrix}
	s^2 + 4(y^2 - x^2) & -8xy & -4sx\\
	-8xy & s^2 + 4(x^2 - y^2) & -4sy\\
	4sx & 4sy & s^2 - 4(x^2 + y^2)
	\end{pmatrix}$$

    <p>where \(x\) and \(y\) are the displacements of the mouse on the screen
    and \(q\) and \(s\) are short for \(1 + x^2 + y^2\) and \(1 - x^2 - y^2\)
    respectively.</p>

    <p>It worked very well and I was happy about it, but there was a little concern: floating point
    approximations.  Since this matrix is made purely out of rational numbers, I was
    wondering if I could try to do exact calculations.  I was expecting things
    to be slower, but I wanted to see how bad it'd be.</p>

    <p>So I picked a <a href="http://peterolson.github.com/BigRational.js">javascript bigrational library</a>
    and gave it a shot:</p>

    <div>
        <div id=a00 style="position:absolute;">Yo!</div>
        <canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="600" style="border:1px solid black, position: absolute;">
            Apparently your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.
        </canvas>
    </div>
    <br>
    <button type=reset id=reset onclick="reset();">Reset</button>

    <p>As you can see, things go smooth at first, but if you keeping
    rotating the cube around, soon enough you'll notice some horrible lag.
    That's because the numerators and denominators in the matrix become 
    bigger and bigger.  The real time value for the first element
    of the matrix is shown above the canvas.<br>
