    <p>On this page I'll try to solve the two-dimensional pendulum problem
    in various ways, including using <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_trigonometry>rational trigonometry</a>.</p>

    <p>I'll start with the simple pendulum, and then maybe the double one and arbitrary long ones.</p>

    <h1>The Simple Pendulum</h1>

    <h2>Lagrangian</h2>
    <p>The Lagrangian for the simple pendulum is
    $$ L = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - mgh $$
    </p>

    <p>With an appropriate choice of length, mass and time units, this 
    can be written:
    $$ L = \frac{v^2}{2} - h $$
    </p>

    <h2>Using trigonometric functions</h2>
    <p>With trigonometric functions, the speed \(v\) and elevation \(h\) become respectively \(\dot\theta\) and
    \(1 - \cos(\theta)\).
    </p>

    <p>The Lagrangian then becomes:
    $$ L = \frac{\dot{\theta}^2}{2} + \cos(\theta) - 1 $$
    </p>
    
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation">Euler-Lagrange equation</a>
    then gives:</p>

    $$ \ddot{\theta} = -\sin{\theta} $$

    <p>which we can turn into a first order derivative by considering
    \(\dot{\theta}\) as an additional variable.</p>

    <h2>Using only rational numbers</h2>

    <p>We're going to use the following rational parametrization of the circle:</p>

    $$\mathrm{M}(\mu) = (\frac{1-\mu^2}{1+\mu^2}, \frac{2\mu}{1+\mu^2}) $$

    <p>The squared speed becomes:
    $$ v^2 = \frac{4\dot{\mu}^2}{(1+\mu^2)^2} $$
    </p>

    <p>Thus the Lagragian is now:
    $$ L = \frac{2\dot{\mu}^2}{(1+\mu^2)^2} + \frac{1-\mu^2}{1+\mu^2} - 1 $$
    </p>

    <p>And the Euler-Lagrange equation:</p>

    $$ \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{4\dot{\mu}}{(1+\mu^2)^2}) =
    -\frac{8\dot{\mu}^2\mu}{(1+\mu^2)^3}
    - \frac{4\mu}{(1+\mu^2)^2}
    $$

    <p>...turns into:</p>

    $$ \frac{4\ddot{\mu}}{(1+\mu^2)^2} - \frac{16\dot{\mu}^2\mu}{(1+\mu^2)^3} =
    -\frac{8\dot{\mu}^2\mu}{(1+\mu^2)^3}
    - \frac{4\mu}{(1+\mu^2)^2}
    $$

    $$ \ddot{\mu} = \frac{2\dot{\mu}^2\mu}{1+\mu^2} - \mu $$

    <h3>Dealing with the exceptional case</h3>

    <p>The naive approach described above has a major issue : it can not
    deal with full swings.  Indeed the point
    $$\lim_{\mu\to\infty}\mathrm{M}(\mu) = (-1, 0)$$
    can never be reached with that parametrization.</p>

    <p>A simple solution is to switch to a different parametrization when it is
    expedient.
    $$\mathrm{N}(\nu) = (-\frac{1-\nu^2}{1+\nu^2}, -\frac{2\nu}{1+\nu^2}) $$
    </p>

    <p>The dynamics should not be much different.  Indeed there is only one sign change:
    $$ \ddot{\nu} = \frac{2\dot{\nu}^2\nu}{1+\nu^2} + \nu $$
    </p>

    <p>We then need a relation between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). That is, we must find the solution
    to
    $$ \mathrm{M}(\mu) = \mathrm{N}(\nu)$$
    </p>

    <p>It is not too hard to see that
    $$ \nu = -\frac{1}{\mu} $$
    is a solution, as long as \(\mu\ne 0\).
    </p>

    <p>From this we can derive the relation between the generalized velocities
    $$ \dot{\nu} = \frac{\dot\mu}{\mu^2},\qquad \dot{\mu} = \frac{\dot\nu}{\nu^2} $$
