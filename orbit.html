    <p>So, recently I've made this:</p>
    <canvas id=asteroid></canvas>
    <p>Normally, you should see an asteroid-looking ball and an elliptic orbit around it.
    If you don't see anything, it can be either that the mesh for the ball is still loading,
    or that your browser doesn't support <a href=https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/>WebGL2</a>.</p>

    <p>If you see the asteroid and the orbit, go ahead and use your mouse to rotate the view,
    as well as the mouse wheel to zoom out and in.</p>

    <p>My goal with this was to learn how to display astrometric data in 3D with WebGL,
    with the dream of doing something similar to what is done in
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program>Kerbal Space Program</a>.
    I'm far from reaching that dream, but this is a start.</p>

    <p>I've made the asteroid model with <a href=http://www.blender.org>blender</a>.  Starting from an UV-sphere, I just added a displacement
    modifier controlled by a "clouds" noise texture.  I then exported the mesh into <a href=https://www.khronos.org/gltf/>glTF</a> using
    the <a href=https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter>Khronos Group glTF-Blender-Exporter</a>.  Importing the mesh 
    from javascript was quite a hassle, but it was interesting and a good learning experience imho.
    </p>

    <p>One neat trick I've learnt while drawing the orbit is that I don't actually need to feed the shader with any vertices buffer.
    I could just use the special variable <tt>gl_VertexID</tt>.  The vertex shader looks like this :

    <pre>#version 300 es

const float tau = 6.283185307179586;

uniform int N;
uniform float a;
uniform float e;
uniform float theta;

uniform mat4 PMatrix;
uniform mat4 VMatrix;
uniform mat4 MMatrix;

out float intensity;

void main() {

   intensity = float(gl_VertexID)/float(N);
   float p = a*(1.0-e*e);
   float phi = theta + tau*intensity;
   gl_Position = PMatrix*VMatrix*MMatrix*vec4( p*cos(phi), p*sin(phi), 0.0, 1.0 + e*cos(phi) );

}</pre>

    As you can see, there is no "in" variable.  All input data is given via uniforms : the only variable
    that changes along the curve is <tt>gl_VertexID</tt>.
    </p>


    <p>The ellipse shows a nice intensity gradient, indicating the position of the orbiting body with time.
    The speed is visibly higher at perigee, and lower at apogee, as expected from basic orbital mechanics.
    I've tried to made this scientifically accurate, and to do that I had to convert the mean anomaly (which evolves
    linearly with time) into the true anomaly.  After reading the corresponding wikipedia articles,
    I've learnt that this can be done first by calculating the eccentric anomaly, which is done by solving 
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation>Kepler's equation</a>.  I did it in javascript,
    by searching the fixed point :
    <pre>function solveKepler(e, M, N = 20) {
  let E = M;
  for(let i = 0; i< N; i++) E = M + e*Math.sin(E);
  return E;
}</pre>
    I picked 20 as the default value for the number of iterations for no reason in particular.</p>

    <p>I'm happy with this little project, but obviously a lot more must be done to make it useful or fun:
    <ul>
      <li>use realistic astronomical parameters, such as the size and mass of the asteroid, and the corresponding
        orbital parameters</li>
      <li>dynamically change the orbital parameters when the orbiting body is submitted to an intrinsic acceleration (engine firing).</li>
      <li>import a model for a spacecraft</li>
      <li>do things like manoeuver nodes in KSP</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I you feel like helping, feel free to contact me on github or Hackernews (I'm grondilu in both).</p>
