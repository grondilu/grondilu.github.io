                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                    Geometric Algebra (GA) is a fascinating concept, but :
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's tough to implement efficiently</li>
                        <li>The existing JS library (
                            <a href="http://versor.mat.ucsb.edu/">versor</a>
                            ) is cumbersome</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hide the complicated typing system from the main API
                            (unlike with versor)</li>
                        <li>Parse 
                            <b><code>"x + pi/2*e0 - e1**2"</code></b>
                            to mean \( x + \frac{\pi}{2}\mathbf{e_0} - \mathbf{e_1}^2 \)
                        </li>
                        <li>Be ultra-generic : infinite dimensions, conformal...</li>
                        <li>Use a sophisticated cache system for optimization</li>
                        <li>Do a bit of formal calculus for real parameters</li>

                        <p>A geometric algebra is an associative algebra with a twist :</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            There exists a vectorial subspace for which all elements
                            have a real square</blockquote>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>In other words :
                        $$\forall \mathbf{v}\in\mathcal{V},\;
                        \mathbf{v}^2\in\mathbb{R}$$
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>That means that all vectorial spaces are geometric algebras,
                        albeit trivial ones : their "vectorial subspace" is the real
                        space.</p>
                        <p>Non-trivial geometric algebras are those for which the dimension
                        of the vectorial subspace is more than one, and different 
                        from the dimension of the algebra.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Although all associative algebras have a natural vectorial
                        space structure, we reserve the word <em>vector</em>
                        to the elements of the <em>vectorial subspace</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>We usually denote vectors with a lowercase,
                        bold roman letter.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Multiplication is called the <em>geometric product</em>.</p>

                        <p>It is noted just like the usual multiplication, that is either
                        with a multiplication sign `*` or with a blank.<p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>For vectors (and for vectors only!),
                        the geometric product is decomposed into
                        a symetric and an anti-symetric part :</p>

                        $$\mathbf{uv} =
                        \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}
                        +\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}$$

                        <p>They are called the <em>inner product</em>
                        and the <em>outer product</em>.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The inner product defines a <em>scalar product</em>
                                in the usual sense of the expression.</li>
                            <li>Only the outer product is easily generalized
                                to any element of the algebra.</li>
                            <li>Along with the geometric product, those two operations are the main tools of GA</li>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>One can build a very generic geometric algebra
                        by taking a vectorial space of infinite (though countable)
                        dimension, with both positive-squared vectors
                        <nobr>(\(\mathbf{v}^2 \gt 0\))</nobr>
                        and negative-squared ones
                        <nobr>(\(\mathbf{v}^2 \lt 0\))</nobr>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such algebra is sometimes called
                        the <b>Universal Alegebra</b>
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>The vector space of the universal algebra
                        has a basis which is made of euclidean vectors
                        $$(\mathbf{e_0},\mathbf{e_1},\ldots)$$
                        and anti-euclidean ones
                        $$(\mathbf{\bar{e}_0},\mathbf{\bar{e}_1},\ldots)$$
                        such that
                        $$\mathbf{e_i}\cdot\mathbf{e_j} = \delta_{ij}$$
                        $$\mathbf{\bar{e}_i}\cdot\mathbf{\bar{e}_j} = -\delta_{ij}$$
                        $$\mathbf{\bar{e}_i}\cdot\mathbf{e_j} =
                        \mathbf{e_i}\cdot\mathbf{\bar{e}_j} = 0
                        $$
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <p>The linear combination of an euclidean vector
                        with an anti-euclidean one can have a null square.
                        Such vector is called a <em>null vector</em>.</p>
                        <p>Two nul vectors are important for the so-called
                        <em>conformal model</em>, which will be discussed later.
                        For now, you can just remember the name and notations
                        for those two : they are called <em>origin</em> and
                        <em>infinity</em> and noted \(o\) and \(\infty\).
                        In the JS code we'll note them `no` and `ni`.
