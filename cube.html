	<p>Below is a colored cube.  It's the same that can be found on this <a href=http://www.tutorialspoint.com/webgl/>this WebGL tutorial</a>.</p>
	You should be able to change the view with your mouse.</p>

	<canvas id="map-canvas" width="800" height="600" style="border:1px solid black;">
	    Apparently your browser does not support HTML5 canvas.

	<p>I've changed the code with the goal of implementing Norman Wildberger's idea of <a
	    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_trigonometry>Rational
	    trigonometry</a>.  Thus there is no trigonometric function (no
	<code>Math.cos</code> nor <code>Math.sin</code>) and no
	<code>Math.sqrt</code> call whatsoever.</p>

	<p>It does not behave exactly quite as expected yet, but I thought it
	was close enough to be worth showing.</p>

	<p>The math can be found <a href=http://www.texpaste.com/n/ev3443eo>here</a>.</p>
